## What does it use?

 - XAML
 - WPF
 - [MahApps](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro)
 - [GamingAnywhere](https://github.com/chunying/gaminganywhere)
 
## Why this project ?
At the time I did this software, I was a student who only knew the imperative programming with the C lang (That's why I have unfortunately not used OOP). Interested in Microsoft technologies, I wanted to learn C# with a first project, this one.
Otherwise, I wanted to allow the distant people to play despite the distance.

## How to run ?
 - Only Windows 7+ is supported (32 and 64 Bits).
 - Works with 16-bit stereo audio, 44100 Hz.
 - Make sure that the machine running server gets an accessible IP address. You also want to turn off Windows firewall and check if both TCP and UDP packets can reach each other.
 - You have to configure your screen DPI to 100% (by default 96 dpi). Otherwise, it will read an incorrect screen size.
